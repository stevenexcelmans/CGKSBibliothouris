Make sure you can save your repositories to a file. Make this file human readable
<details><summary>Hint:</summary>

1. Try to search for serialisation and Java.
2. You may use XML or JSON, for JSON jackson is already configured as a dependency.
3. Don't make it performant, just make a new file everytime you add/remove/update an element.
4. Use lazy loading.
5. If you want to speed things up, search and use multi threading. This is an advanced topic.
6. Do this in a separate class, and when you're up to it make it generic.
